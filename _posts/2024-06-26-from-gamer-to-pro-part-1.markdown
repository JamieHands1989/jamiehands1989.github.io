For years, my trusty Corsair K70 RGB Rapidfire served me well in the world of PC gaming. But as a developer who spends more time writing code than slaying dragons, the keyboard's lightning-fast actuation distance started causing more typos than triumphs. It was time for a change, a keyboard upgrade fit for a modern coder's needs.

The obvious choice? The classic QWERTY keyboard. Here's the problem: QWERTY, a relic from the typewriter era, isn't optimized for the modern desk. Its staggered rows, designed to prevent typewriter hammers from clashing, are unnecessary for keyboards. Thankfully, the keyboard revolution is underway.

Companies are reimagining the keyboard for the 21st century, offering a plethora of layouts and programmable features. We've seen the rise of compact 75% and 60% layouts, freeing up valuable desk space. Now, even more radical designs are emerging.

Staggered columns replace the dated rows, mimicking the natural reach of our fingers. Each column caters to a specific finger length, maximizing typing comfort. Additionally, thumb clusters take advantage of our strongest digits, allowing them to operate multiple keys instead of just the spacebar.

These innovative keyboards come at a premium price, targeting the "power user" willing to invest in a niche product. Here's where my project comes in.

Inspired by commercially available split ergonomic keyboards, I'm building a custom keyboard with a staggered column layout. It will share this core layout for ergonomic typing but with my own personal touch. Let's break down the key features:

Split ergonomic keyboard layout for optimized typing comfort

Compact design enabled by a custom-designed PCB

MX Hot-swappable switches for easy customization

Mirrored PCB usable for both left and right halves

Home-assembled for a DIY adventure

3D printed case designed and printed at home

Now, full disclosure: I'm a complete novice in this domain. PCB design, CAD, electronics, firmware coding, and precise 3D printing â€“ the challenges ahead are daunting.

But I'm up for the adventure. Join me on this journey! By the time you finish reading this series, my custom keyboard will be complete. Hopefully, you'll find the process informative and maybe even inspiring. Stay tuned for the next article, where we dive headfirst into PCB design!
